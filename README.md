# FinalProject-Assessment

Self-Assessment
I am from the Team 7. We are a team of four members and each of us had the following roles:
1) Triangle role - Claudia Martin - Machine Learning
- Evaluate models
- Make recommendations based on accuracy

2) X role - Falki Sabha - Presentation/Dashboard
- Created two Storyboards with multiple Dashboards
- Created the initial presentation content
- Created the finaly summary with the conclusions and findings

3) Square Role - Awalin Buttar - Github/Dashboard
- Manageg Github repository (i.e. commits, merge requests, etc.)
- Provided assistance in two Dashbaords

4) Circle Role - Gopinath Vasanthakumar - Database
- Clean Data
- Process Data and store in PostgreSQL DB
- Normalize Data based on Keys

Apart from the roles mentioned above, we would engage in team discussions where we would:
1) Constantly review the overall process and individual deliverables
2) Asist one another with their tasks by providing input through discussions
3) Work togethor to review the final PowerPoint Presentation and improving it constantly

Team-Assessment
As a team, we used the following communication channels:
1) Slack: for communication
2) Google Drive: for sharing files and data between the team
3) Google Docs: for collaborating wtih the team simultaneously
4) Virtual Meetings: for working togethor and brainstorming amongst ourselves

As a team, we have faced the following challenges:
1) Communication Lag
- Since we all had different schedules, we faced a lag in communication (sometimes it was hard to get a hold of people)
- We overcame this by creating Google Sheets with clear details so that we could all follow along (and update), so that we would all be on the same page

2) Miscommunication
- At times we would also misinterpret information
- We overcame this agian by creating detailed Google Sheets so that we would overcome this

Summary of Project
Our primary goal was to anaylze the performance of the Raptors Team during their appearance in 2018-2019 NBA Championship. Throughout this project, we used the following tools Postgres (Database), Pandas (Machine Learning), Tableau Prep Builder (Cleaning Data) and Tableau (Dashboards). The best Machine Learning Algorithm based on accuracy turned out to be the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier with a balanced accuracy score of 86.7%. Although we analyzed data for the Raptors Team, this project can easily be repurposed for any other sports team. The analysis could help Coaches, Players, and Sponsors.
